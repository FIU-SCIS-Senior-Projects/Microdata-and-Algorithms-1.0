# Microdata-and-Algorithms-1.0

This project requires Java 8. You can build this project by compiling the java source files located at Microdata-and-Algorithms-1.0/code/IntensityFilter/src/pkg1. The IntensityFilter folder is a NetBeans 8.1 Java Application Project, so if you have NetBeans you can treat it as such.

It's simple, but effective.
